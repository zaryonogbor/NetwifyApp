Product Requirements Document (PRD) 
i. Overview 
Netwify is a mobile-first networking application designed to replace traditional paper business 
cards at events. It enables professionals to exchange digital business cards via QR code 
scanning, build verified mutual connections, and leverage AI to remember context and generate 
high-quality follow-up messages. 
The MVP focuses on fast connection exchange, mutual consent, and AI-assisted relationship 
management. 
ii. Problem Statement 
Professionals attending events face the following challenges: 
• Paper business cards are easily lost or forgotten 
• Phone contact saving is slow and error-prone 
• No context is retained about where or why a contact was met 
• Follow-ups are often delayed, generic, or never sent 
iii. Solution 
Netwify provides: 
• Instant QR-based digital card exchange 
• Mutual consent before contacts are saved 
• Smart AI-generated summaries to preserve meeting context 
• AI-assisted personalized follow-up message generation 
iv. Vision & Mission 
Vision: To become the default global infrastructure for professional networking—replacing 
paper business cards, fragmented contact saving, and forgotten follow-ups. 
Mission: Help people turn real-world meetings into meaningful, trackable, and lasting 
professional relationships using smart identity exchange and AI-powered context.
